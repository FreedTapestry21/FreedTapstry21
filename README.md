Hey there! I'm Freed!

I do stuff with technology (Mostly software).   
I do a lot of things with Arduino's and Raspberry pi's.   
I do my projects with passion and my own motivation, not on request.    

Here are some places where you can contact me:
- Website: http://freeddev.uk.to
- Twitter: @ItsBoGames_YT
- Discord: @FreedTapstry21#0041 (Only for urgent messages. Thank you.)

BTW, I'm pretty new to Github so don't excpect to much goodness.  

Have a nice day!
